## QR Code Stickers

A QR code is automatically generated per-person, which when scanned on the day that presents are given (configurable in the docker-compose.yml), will reveal who the present is for.

You can view all of the QR codes here: http://localhost:5000/qrcodes

The QR codes will not be active until both of the following conditions are true:

1. It is the day of giving the presents
2. The QR codes have been activated by visiting http://localhost:5000/qr-toggle (configurable in the docker-compose.yml)

## Songs on QR Code Activation

If you set `USE_SONGS` to true in the docker-compose.yml, a song will play per person when the QR codes are activated. The songs are stored in the `static/songs` directory.

Save a song in the `static/songs` directory and name it `firstname.mp3` (e.g. `harry.mp3`), and it will play when the QR code is activated for that person.

The song should be around 30 seconds long, but there is no set limit.
