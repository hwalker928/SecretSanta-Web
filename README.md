## QR Code Stickers

A QR code is automatically generated per-person, which when scanned on the day that presents are given (configurable in the docker-compose.yml), will reveal who the present is for.

You can view all of the QR codes here: http://localhost:5000/qrcodes

The QR codes will not be active until both of the following conditions are true:
1. It is the day of giving the presents
2. The QR codes have been activated by visiting http://localhost:5000/qr-toggle (configurable in the docker-compose.yml)
